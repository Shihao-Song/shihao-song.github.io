        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
        I'm Dr. Shihao Song, a Senior Lead GPU Architect at NVIDIA and a passionate believer in education and advisory roles. Outside my primary role, I serve as an Affiliate Professor and Board Advisor at Drexel University, where I focus on students' long-term development through the supervision and creation of advanced, industry-aligned courses and academic-industry partnerships. Additionally, I advise stealth and early-stage startups on assessing early market targets and developing technical and strategic roadmaps, as well as support research projects aimed at benefiting the general public.

                            Drexel offers a parallel programming class teaching CUDA for high-performance computing and AI. To deepen students' understanding beyond typical academic content, my guest lecture focused on CUDA's internal mechanisms—how it works behind the scenes—and introduced state-of-the-art GPU architecture, empowering students to stay at the forefront of GPU technology developments.
