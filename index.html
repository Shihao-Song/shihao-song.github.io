        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
        I'm Dr. Shihao Song, a Senior Lead GPU Architect at NVIDIA and a passionate believer in education and advisory roles. Outside my primary role, I serve as an Affiliate Professor and Board Advisor at Drexel University, where I focus on students' long-term development through the supervision and creation of advanced, industry-aligned courses and academic-industry partnerships. Additionally, I advise stealth and early-stage startups on assessing early market targets and developing technical and strategic roadmaps, as well as support research projects aimed at benefiting the general public.

                <strong>Instructor on <span style="color:green;">Compiler Design </span> at Drexel University (April 2025 - June 2025)</strong><br>
                    Students will create their own programming language and write a compiler for it that translates this language all the way down to machine code which can be executed on the Intel IA-64 architecture. All m
                    ajor steps of the translation process will be covered: scanning, syntax analysis, code generation, and code optimization. The compiler will be developed using LLVM (https://llvm.org/), a very popular compiler infrastructure toolchain used by developers to create new programming languages or domain specific languages. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aM-wRUH7UnSbY-or0DyIwSTXRCChJe_-/view?usp=sharing">View Syllabus</a>

                <strong>Guest Speaker on <span style="color:green;">AI Hardware & Systems: CUDA Internals</span> at Drexel University (March 2025)</strong><br>
                            Drexel offers a parallel programming class teaching CUDA for high-performance computing and AI. To deepen students' understanding beyond typical academic content, my guest lecture focused on CUDA's internal mechanisms—how it works behind the scenes—and introduced state-of-the-art GPU architecture, empowering students to stay at the forefront of GPU technology developments.
